# HTML Slide Show
Try here: [goodjonte.github.io/HTMLSlideShow](https://goodjonte.github.io/HTMLSlideShow)

Simple slideshow player for images, "upload" images and set a delay and your away.

All in one file to keep things simple.

Because localstorage and other methods are limited to the size of data stored, this app simply just converts the images to a Data Url and adds them to the HTML DOM.
